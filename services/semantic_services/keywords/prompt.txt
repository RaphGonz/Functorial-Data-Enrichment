Extract high-signal keywords from the text.

Rules:
- Output only keywords, not sentences.
- Each keyword must be a single word (1 token). No multi-word phrases.
- Prefer nouns and adjectives over verbs.
- Exclude named entities (people, places, organizations) unless they are the core topic.
- Exclude stopwords, generic fillers, and function words.
- Keep the text’s language; do not translate.
- Normalize to lowercase unless the keyword is an unavoidable proper noun/acronym.
- No duplicates. No near-duplicates (merge variants).
