Summarize the text in very simple language so it can be used to generate an image.

Rules:
- Use short sentences.
- Use concrete words.
- Keep only what can be shown visually: characters/subjects, setting, key objects, key actions, mood/lighting.
- Remove abstract ideas, analysis, opinions, and background details that cannot be seen.
- If the text is not a story, describe the scene it implies.
- Do not add new details.
